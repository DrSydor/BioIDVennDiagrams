# BioIDVennDiagrams
To compare a BioID Dataset with multiple baits to one with a single bait and 
generate Venn Diagrams comparing the two datasets. This script accepts .txt 
files where each line has a separate bait-prey interaction listed. Saves the
resulting Venn Diagrams and list of common proteins as a PDF file.
